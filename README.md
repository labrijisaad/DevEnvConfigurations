# 🚀 Personal Development Environment Setup 🛠️

This repository acts as a guide to my preferred IDE configuration, system settings, and selected technologies. The main aim is to offer an `easily replicable setup`.

## Makefile Usage for `Data Science Projects` 🛠️

Utilize the Makefile for easy project setup and management. Here are the available commands:

- `make init`: Initialize the project's structure.
- `make setup`: Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.
- `make update`: Update dependencies in the virtual environment.
- `make clean`: Clean up the virtual environment and generated files.
- `make jupyter`: Activate the virtual environment and run Jupyter Lab.

These commands help streamline your development workflow, ensuring a consistent environment and smooth project operations.

## IDE Personalization - PyCharm 💻

### Plugins 🔌
Check out these cool PyCharm plugins that enhance the IDE experience:

- [Atom Material File Icons](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10044-atom-material-icons)

- [Solarized Theme](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12112-solarized-theme)

### Code Zoom 🕶️
Get closer to your code with these simple steps:

1. Navigate to `File > Settings` (or `PyCharm > Preferences` on macOS).
2. In the `General` section, locate `Mouse Control`.
3. Activate code zoom using your mouse wheel.

### Solarized Theme ☀️
Transform your PyCharm interface with the Solarized Theme:

1. Open `File > Settings` (or `PyCharm > Preferences` on macOS).
2. Under `Appearance & Behavior`, select `Appearance`.
3. Choose the `Solarized Dark` theme from the available options.

### Green Console Output 🌿
Give your console output a refreshing green touch:

1. Access `File > Settings` (or `PyCharm > Preferences` on macOS).
2. In the `Editor` section, find `Color Scheme`.
3. Customize the `Console Colors` settings to make standard and system outputs appear in green.
