# 🚀 Personal Development Environment Setup 🛠️

This repository acts as a guide to my preferred IDE configuration, system settings, and selected technologies. The main aim is to offer an `easily replicable setup`.

## Makefile Usage for `Data Science Projects` 🛠️

Utilize the Makefile for easy project setup and management. Here are the available commands:

- `make init`: Initialize the project's structure.
- `make setup`: Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.
- `make update`: Update dependencies in the virtual environment.
- `make clean`: Clean up the virtual environment and generated files.
- `make jupyter`: Activate the virtual environment and run Jupyter Lab.

These commands help streamline your development workflow, ensuring a consistent environment and smooth project operations.
