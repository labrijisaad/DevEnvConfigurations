# 🚀 Personal Development Environment Setup 🛠️

This repository acts as a guide to my preferred IDE configuration, system settings, and selected technologies. The main aim is to offer an `easily replicable setup`.

## IDE Personalization - PyCharm 💻

### Plugins 🔌
Check out these cool PyCharm plugins that enhance the IDE experience:

### Code Zoom 🕶️
Dive into your code details:

1. Go to `File > Settings` (or `PyCharm > Preferences` on macOS).
2. Under `General`, locate `Mouse Control`.
3. Enable code zoom using your mouse wheel.

### Solarized Theme ☀️
Setting up the Solarized Theme:

1. Open `File > Settings` (or `PyCharm > Preferences` on macOS).
